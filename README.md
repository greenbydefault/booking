# Booking Platform for Webflow

This simple application provides a dashboard where users can register, log in and create products that can be booked via a small script snippet. The snippet can be embedded in Webflow and displays the product information based on a `data-product` attribute.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
node src/server.js
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` and register a user. After logging in, you can create products and copy the embed code shown in the dashboard.
